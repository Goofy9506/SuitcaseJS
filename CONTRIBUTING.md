# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to SuitcaseJS! These are the guidelines if you are willing to contribute.

## Issues

1. _Remember, a search bar exists..._ So you must look for open issues with the same problem and have some discussion instead of creating another one.
2. For bug reports, make sure reproduction is as accurate as possible.
3. The intention of **Suitcase.js** is to make packs and files _really_ compact for production and improve Minecraft pack users' and developers' experience. So it must be on topic with this project!

## Steps in Pull Requests

2. In your repository, create a new branch of any name.
